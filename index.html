              Bavin Philippines is one of the famous Electronic product company in the Philippines. They supplies,
              Quality electronic cables such as phone chargers, earphones, extensions, speakers, etc,... When it
              comes to quality and budget electronic cables most of the Filipinos chooses to use Bavin rather than
              unbranded products. They accept franchise and resellers, they support small capital for those who want
              to resell their products. just like us, Centralized has been supplied by Bavin Philippines for 1 year. 
              they treat equaly those resellers and franchisee.
